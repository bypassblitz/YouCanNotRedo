the last thing I changed, but did not export in save was setting all weapon durabilities from 77 to 0
April-12 The above change was applied, all weapons are now unbreakable
April-12 Included are custom evangelion-sound-rips which are unused in this first release, due to Mcreator's horrible sound interface which plays sounds globaly or not at all, none were used natively.
April-12 In the future if I can I intend to add a command script for the spear of Gaius, which allows the user to rename the server.properties world=LevelName, however I don't know if this is possible although other mods do add this feature through commands.
